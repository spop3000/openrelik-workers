# Yara scanner OpenRelik worker

## Overview

This worker scans input files or folders with Yara rules. It sources the rules from a given directory. It supports disk images that will be mounted.

## Installation

OpenRelik yara worker can be installed by using the pre-built Docker image.

**Note on Privileges:** If you would like this worker to support mounting disk images this worker requires `privileged` mode capabilities and the `/dev/` volume mapped to perform necessary mounting operations (e.g., mounting disk images). Be aware of the security implications of granting these privileges.

### Using Pre-built Docker Image

Update the `docker-compose.yml` to include `openrelik-worker-yara`.

```yaml
openrelik-worker-yara:
  container_name: openrelik-worker-yara
  image: ghcr.io/openrelik/openrelik-worker-yara:${OPENRELIK_WORKER_YARA_VERSION}
  privileged: true
  restart: always
  environment:
    - REDIS_URL=redis://openrelik-redis:6379
    - OPENRELIK_YARA_RULES_FOLDER=/data/yara/
  volumes:
    - ./data:/usr/share/openrelik/data
    - /dev:/dev
  command: "celery --app=src.app worker --task-events --concurrency=4 --loglevel=INFO -Q openrelik-worker-yara"
```

## Loading Yara rules
The worker can be loaded with yara rules in 2 different ways.
1. Through the text input fiels shown in the UI
2. Through the folder path input field shown in the UI

The second option can be used to bootstrap persistent default rules. As shown above the shared volume is mapped into the container as `/usr/share/openrelik/data`. You can create a subfolder called `yara` there and bootstrap it with e.g. below ruleset from [Florian Roth](https://github.com/Neo23x0). 
```
mkdir -p ./data/yara
cd ./data/yara
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base.git
```

When running the worker you set the folder path to `/usr/share/openrelik/data/yara/` and it will use the rules.

## Building and running fraken-x Docker image
The fraken-x source and container is built separately to keep the openrelik-worker-yara build independent and fast. The image is available at `ghcr.io/openrelik/fraken-x` and can be used standalone.

Build
```
$ docker build -t ghcr.io/openrelik/fraken-x -f Dockerfile.fraken .
```

Run
```
$ docker run -ti ghcr.io/openrelik/fraken-x fraken-x --help
Usage: fraken-x [OPTIONS] <--folder <FOLDER>|--testrules> <RULES>

Arguments:
  <RULES>  Specify a particular path to a file or folder containing the Yara rules to use

Options:
  -f, --folder <FOLDER>      Specify a particular folder to be scanned
      --testrules            Test the rules for syntax validity and then exit
      --magic <MAGIC>        A path under the rules path that contains File Magics [default: misc/file-type-signatures.txt]
      --minscore <MINSCORE>  Only rules with scores greater than this will be output [default: 40]
      --maxsize <MAXSIZE>    Only files less than this size will be scanned [default: 1073741824]
  -h, --help                 Print help

```
